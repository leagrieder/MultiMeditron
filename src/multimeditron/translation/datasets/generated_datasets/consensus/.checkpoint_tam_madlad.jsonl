Electronic IDSR (eIDSR) is the application of electronic tools to principles of IDSR to facilitate prevention, prediction, detection, reporting and response.

The eHSI is also used to track the health status of patients and their caregivers. In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a resolution on eHealth:- (a) e-health, which means transmission of health information over the traditional classroom;- (b) tele-health;- e-learning;- m-health.There are two main types of eHealth platforms.In both HMIS and e IDSR, there is an active and timely means of collecting data on health facilities OPD or IPD registers, and conditions which are extracted from either the OPD register or the IPD registry. The most widely used electronic platform of HMIS is DHIS2.
