{"translation": "4.3.1A – Monitoring and an assessment:** Interventions on climate resilience in health care facilities can contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions by reducing the amount of energy consumed by the health care facility. Climate change can impact on energy access in many ways and in all types of health care institutions. Although many health care establishments lack regular electricity access (whether from an electricity grid or generated locally), this access can be further limited. Extreme weather events, such as storms, may damage power lines or solar panels. Floods may affect generators or battery storage. Heat wave may increase electricity use in cities to power air conditioning, leading to rationing or outages. Most of these can be overcome with good planning for which increasing number of resources are becoming available.*(51,52).*Renewable energies can be harnessed through photovoltaic cells to heat water or generate electricity (which can be stored in batteries) across cities and buildings, while closed loop or low enthalpy geothermal systems can provide low carbon thermal heating alternative.**Interventions table 4", "status": "success"}
